      <p>When not fighting crime, Batman likes to relax in his garden. Superheros have to eat and eat well. When the busy schedule of the world's greatest detective keeps him from getting to the Gotham City Farmer's market every week, it's good to have fresh produce on hand. </p>

      <p> The Batman Gotham Farm Stand is a project intended to share the surplus produce from Batman's garden. Stay tuned to find out which crops the caped crusader and his business partner Batgirl will have available for sale in July of 2016. </p>
