I'm trying to create a black bar that spans the top of the page, with head line and navigation butts within. Also tried to get footer to stay at bottom of content which worked for awhile but now is perhaps creating this problem. I used a container div with 100% height and lost track of how to build the rest to spread out with footer at bottom of page rather than just below the photo. Photo is also behind the nav div and header.-->

      <p>When not fighting crime, Batman likes to relax in his garden. Superheros have to eat and eat well. When the busy schedule of the world's greatest detective keeps him from the Gotham City Farmer's market, it's good to have fresh produce on hand.

      	The Batman Gotham Farm Stand is a project intended to share the surplus produce from Batman's garden. Stay tuned to find out which crops the caped crusader and his business partner Batgirl will have available for sale in July of 2016. </p>
